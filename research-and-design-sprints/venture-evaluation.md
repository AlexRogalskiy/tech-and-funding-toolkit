## [Toolkit for Evaluating a New Venture](https://medium.com/@seikatsu/toolkit-for-evaluating-a-new-venture-c6ee623a4bca)

People (founders, employees, other providers of resources to the venture):

* Who are the founders?
* Who are other people involved?
* What have they accomplished in the past?
* What directly relevant experience do they have for the opportunity?
* What skills do they have?
* Whom do they know and who knows them?
* What is their reputation?
* How realistic are they?
* Can they adapt if circumstances warrant?
* Are the founders prepared to recruit high quality people?
* Who is missing from the team?
* How will they be attracted?
* How will the team respond to adversity?
* Can they make the inevitable hard choices?
* What are their motivations?
* How committed are they to this venture?
* How can I gain objective information about each member of the team (including how they will work together)?
* What are the possible consequences if one or more of the team members leaves?
* Opportunity (activity requiring investment of scarce resources in hopes of future return):

What is the nature of the opportunity?
* Does this venture engage in direct combat, or “sell ammunition to all sides of the war”? If this is an arbitrage opportunity: when does it go away and what is the big plan then?
* Is the total market for the product/service large and/or rapidly growing?
* Is the industry one that is now or can become structurally attractive?
* What are the appropriate analogies?
* If the venture is successful, what will it look like?
* How will the company make money?
* Who is the customer?
* How does the customer make decisions?
* To what degree is the product/service a compelling purchase for the customer?
* How will the product/service be priced?
* How will the venture reach the identified customer segments?
* How much does it cost (time & resources) to acquire a new customer?
* How much does it cost to produce & deliver the product/service?
* How much does it cost to support a customer?
* How easy is it to retain a customer?
* How is the opportunity likely to evolve?
* Is there more than one cash flow source in sight?
* Can entry barriers be built and maintained?
* To what degree does the company have control over the rate at which it exploits an opportunity?
* Who else is (or might be) pursuing the same opportunity?
* Who wrote the financial projections and why (for which audience)?
* Do the pro forma projections show evidence of a business model that makes sense? (as specific numbers are almost certain to be wrong)
* What are the key drivers in the business model that will determine success or failure?
* Has any sensible sensitivity analysis been done on impact of changes in these key drivers?
* Who came up with the idea for the opportunity and how? (e.g who owns the IP)
* Is there anyone who could disagree with the previous answer?
* Context (factors that impact the outcome, but are out of founder’s direct control):

What external factors will affect the venture?
* Is the team aware of the context and how it helps or hinders their plan?
* How might contextual changes affect the business?
* What can you do in the event the context worsens? (interest rates, regulation)
* What can you do to affect context in positive way? (impact on regulation, industry standards)
* Deal (implicit & explicit contractual relationships between the venture and all resource providers, not limited to just investors):

What deals have been (or are likely to be) struck inside and outside the venture?
* How do the deals struck increase the likelihood of success?
* How will those deals and the implicit incentives evolve over time?
* What new information would dramatically change your perception of the likelihood of success for a given venture?
* How much time and money are required to “buy” that information? (e.g how to stage investments based on progress)
* From whom should the money be raised?
* How much money is needed and for what purpose?
* What deal terms are fair and provide appropriate incentives for each side under a wide range of scenarios?
* What are the consequences of losing the time race with competition?
* What are the incentive effects of allocation of risk & reward? (e.g is the risk tolerance of parties in sync)
* Does the deal provide any perverse incentives that can cause one or both parties to behave in destructive ways?
* Who will be attracted by the deal terms offered?
* What are the logical implications if the parties to a deal behave in their own perceived best interest?
* Is the deal complex and can it be simplified?
* Is the deal fair to involved parties?
* Does the deal reflect trust rather than legalese?
* Is the deal robust or will it blow apart if actual differs even slightly from plan?
* Does the deal (even accidentally) foreclose any valuable options?
* What decisions have been made (or can be made) to increase the ratio of reward to risk?
* Fit (how the puzzle plugs together — hold 3 aspects constant to validate the fourth with specific questions):

* To what degree do the people have the right experience, skills and attitudes, given the nature of the opportunity, the context and the deals already struck?
* To what degree do the deals involved in the venture make sense, given the people involved, the nature of the opportunity and the context?
etc…
